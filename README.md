# Cotton-Disease-Classification . 

This project is about cotton disease classification , which consist colourful images of cotton plant leaves and we have to predict whether the leaf is fresh or diseased it is binary classification problem .  I have used "Inception V3" and "Resnet152"  pretrained Deep learning models to get the results . I have uploaded .h5 file of Inception V3 model also.


Here are some images present inside dataset

## My approach

I have also written my approach in in provided kaggle notebook to
