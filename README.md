# Cotton-Disease-Classification . 

This project is about cotton disease classification , which consist colourful images of cotton plant leaves and we have to predict whether the leaf is fresh or diseased it is binary classification problem .  I have used "Inception V3" and "Resnet152"  pretrained Deep learning models to get the results . I have uploaded .h5 file of Inception V3 model also.


Here are some images present inside dataset

## My approach

I have also written my approach in in provided kaggle notebook to

# Observations during training of Model

1) Loss vs Epochs plot

2) Accuracy vs Epochs plot

# UI for Uploading and Predicting to classify diseased and healthy leaves . It is hosted on local server


1) Click on choose to upload the image of the leaf
